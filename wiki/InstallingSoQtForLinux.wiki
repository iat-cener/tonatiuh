Open a shell console, navigate to downlaod directory and extract the archive by typing:
{{{
tar -zxvf SoQt-1.5.0.tar.gz
}}}
This will create a directory called _!SoQt-1.5.0_ in your user directory. Using the shell navigate to the just created !SoQt-1.5.0. directory and type:
{{{
export COINDIR="/usr/local"
export INCLUDE="/usr/local/include:/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.7/qt/include"
}}}

Type configure command for release build:
{{{
./configure --enable-debug=no --enable-symbols=no --with-coin=/usr/local --with-qt=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.7/qt
}}}

This will start the configuration process. This process should finish succesfully with the following message:
{{{
SoQt configuration settings:
  Open Inventor brand:  Coin
  Static Materials:     Yes
  Installation Prefix:  /usr/local

Now, run 'make install' to build and install SoQt.
}}} 

Then, to install the !SoQt libraries type:
{{{
make
make install
}}}

Once the !SoQt library is installed the next step is to install the Marble library. To do it, follow the instructions in the following wiki page: [InstallingMarbleForLinux  Installing Marble for Linux].
