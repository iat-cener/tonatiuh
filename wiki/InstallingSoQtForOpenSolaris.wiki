{{{
./configure --enable-debug=no --enable-symbols=no --with-coin=/usr/local --with-qt=/usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.6.2 
make
pfexec make install
}}}

At the end of the installation process, the !SoQt library will be installed at _"/usr/local/lib"_. Now, you can proceed to the installation of [InstallingMarbleForOpenSolaris Marble].
