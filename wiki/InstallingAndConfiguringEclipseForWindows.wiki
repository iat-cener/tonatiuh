== Installing the Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers == 

Download the latest version of the_"Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers"_ from the Eclipse website. To do it, click on the following [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ link] to go to the "Downloads" webpage of the Eclipse website. Once you reach the webpage, click on the appropriate version (Windows 32 Bit or Windows 64 Bit) of the link titled _"Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers" (see Figure 1). Then follow the instructions to select a mirror site from where to download the compressed package file. When prompted, select the appropriate option to store the file in your computer. Currently, the latest version of the compressed package file is titled _"eclipse-cpp-helios-SR1-win32.zip"_.
