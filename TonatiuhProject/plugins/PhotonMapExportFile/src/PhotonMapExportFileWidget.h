Acknowledgments:

The development of Tonatiuh was started on 2004 by Dr. Manuel J. Blanco,
then Chair of the Department of Engineering of the University of Texas at
Brownsville. From May 2004 to July 2008, it was supported by the Department
of Energy (DOE) and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) under
the Minority Research Associate (MURA) Program Subcontract ACQ-4-33623-06.
During 2007, NREL also contributed to the validation of Tonatiuh under the
framework of the Memorandum of Understanding signed with the Spanish
National Renewable Energy Centre (CENER) on February, 20, 2007 (MOU#NREL-07-117).
Since June 2006, the development of Tonatiuh is being led by the CENER, under the
direction of Dr. Blanco, now Director of CENER Solar Thermal Energy Department.
